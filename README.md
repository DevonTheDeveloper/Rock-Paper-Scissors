### Description
JavaScript Project: Rock Paper Scissors by [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com)

#### What did I use for this?
I used the following technologies for this project:
- JavaScript
- CSS3
- HTML5

#### What difficulties did I face?
I faced a good amount of difficulties, but those were also learning experiences. I needed help for adding EventListeners, displaying scores and some othr stuff. It was definitely a great learning experience.

  ## Why did I make this?

I made this project because it was in the TOP curriculum, my main motivation was that great feeling that you have after finishing something hard. It was dreadful, but also a good learning process.

  

## What did I learn?

I learnt about AND and OR operators, randomizing numbers, arrays, building functions, manipulating the DOM, eventListeners, a lot. I definitely made a lot of progress in my knowledge of JavaScript in these 2 days (Yes, it took me 2 days, very long.) but I’m happy I got stuck and had to ask for help as the TOP community really helped me understand things, but also doing.

  

## How does it work?

All you have to do is press the buttons to make your choice, and you’ll be playing a game of Rock Paper Scissors!
