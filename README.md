### Description
JavaScript Project: Rock Paper Scissors by [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com)

#### What did I use for this?
I only used JavaScript for this project, as that was the assignment.

#### What difficulties did I face?
I faced a good amount of difficulties, but those were also learning experiences. A couple of moments I needed help was for validating the strings, getting the for loop to work the way it needed to and randomizing the computers choice. 

  ## Why did I make this?

I made this project because it was in the TOP curriculum, my main motivation was the feeling that I’d have another finishing this project. It was dreadful, but also a good learning process.

  

## What did I learn?

I learnt about AND and OR operators, randomizing numbers, arrays, building functions, a lot. I definitely made a lot of progress in my knowledge of JavaScript in these 2 days (Yes, it took me 2 days, very long.) but I’m happy I got stuck and had to ask for help as the TOP community really helped me understand things, but also doing.

  

## How does it work?

The way this project works is that it is all in the console, later on I’ll add a UI. So just open your Developer Tools (`Windows: Ctrl + Shift + I` & `Mac: Option + Command + I`) and fill in the prompts and you’ll be able to play, if you want to restart though you’ll have to refresh the page.
